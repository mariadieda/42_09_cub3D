Hello Maria,

for the first time I had to run the following:

chmod +x minilibx-linux/configure
( cd minilibx-linux && ./configure )

and then "make".

./cub3D maps/map.cub

I have updated some stuff regarding keypress and the window. 
My next step will be to load the images , probably at the end of next week: 6-7/12

See you!
